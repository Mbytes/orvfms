    1. Unzip /untar the code under your server {DocumentRoot} directory;
    2. Check and update your home network broadcast address in {Document Root}/lib/orvfms/globals.php.
       If required, replace the address in line

       define("IP_BROADCAST","192.168.1.255");

       with your local broadcast address. 
    3. Start your web server
    4. Access the code at http://your.server.adress/s20 (or http://localhost/, if the browser and server
       share the same host).

In order to isolate the code from other pages, you may untar/unzip under {DocumentRoot}/yourdirname. 
In this case, the web page will be available under http://your.server.adress/yourdirname/s20.
