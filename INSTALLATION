DISCLAIMER:
   This software was developed independently and it is not
   supported or endorsed in any way by Orvibo (C).

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS:
    This software was based on the information originally published 
    by Andrius Å tikonas on 

https://stikonas.eu/wordpress/2015/02/24/reverse-engineering-orvibo-s20-socket/	

    and on comments and discussions by many other users, 
    as well as some complementar reverse engineering 
    analysis (see TECHNICAL_DATA.txt).

INSTALLATION (fast track):
    More detailed installation instructions are available in the README file. We include here a short version, 
    please refer to the README if you have any issues.

    1. Unzip /untar the code under your server {DocumentRoot} directory;
    2. Check and update your home network broadcast address in 
       {Document Root}/lib/orvfms/globals.php.

       If required, replace the address in line

       define("IP_BROADCAST","192.168.1.255");

       with your local broadcast address. 
    4. If you want to create and store scenes, edit also the line in globals.php
       
       define("TMP_DIR",""); 

       and define here an existing  permanent directory that can be *written* by your http server, 
       for example:
	
	define("TMP_DIR","/mytmp");
	

       When left with the default empty string, the code will store working data files,
       namely scene data, on the system default temporary directory. However, this directory
       may be erased due to system maintenance procedures or reboot operation, and 
       scene configuration will be lost.
    5. Start your web server
    6. Access the code at http://your.server.adress/s20 (or http://localhost/, if the 
       browser and server share the same host).

In order to isolate the code from other pages, you may untar/unzip under {DocumentRoot}/yourdirname. 
In this case, the web page will be available under http://your.server.adress/yourdirname/s20.
